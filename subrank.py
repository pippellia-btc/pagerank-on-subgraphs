            A directed Networkx graph, induced subgraph of G

            a Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix; element (i,j) is equal to

        nodelist: list, optional
            the list of nodes in G Networkx graph. It is used to decode walk_visited_count
        
       alpha: float, optional
            It is the dampening factor of Pagerank. default value is 0.85

        OUTPUTS
        -------
        subrank: dict
            The dictionary {node: pg} of the pagerank value for each node in S
