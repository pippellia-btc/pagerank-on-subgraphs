# Pagerank on subgraphsâ€”efficient Monte-Carlo estimation

In this repo you can find the reference code for my novel Subrank algorithm for efficiently computing the Pagerank distribution over $S$ subgraph of $G$.
For the reasoning behind the algorithm, the definition and the analysis, I invite the interested reader to [read the paper](https://pippellia.com/pippellia/Social+Graph/Pagerank+on+subgraphs%E2%80%94efficient+Monte-Carlo+estimation).

**Note**: The code is not intended for production use, as it lacks many performance optimizations, such as parallelization of random walks. Its purpose is to provide a reference implementation of the Subrank algorithm that is easy to read and understand.

To play with it, check out the Jupyter notebook `subrank_demo_notebook.ipynb`

## Results

On random 3-hops subgraphs, the algorithm shows its best performance, reducing the number of random walks to be performed by ~94.6% on average. This is a considerable reduction in overhead compared to the naive algorithm that simply recomputes all random walks.

Despite the dramatic reduction in overhead, the algorithm achieves a very similar error compared to the naive recomputation.
